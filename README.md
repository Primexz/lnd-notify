# LND Notify

A notification system for Lightning Network nodes that monitors and notifies about important events.
This project is heavily inspured by balanceofsatoshis(https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis), but with the aim of offering much greater customisation and a wider range of notification destinations.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of LND node events
- Configurable notifications for:
  - Payment forward
  - Channel Open
  - Channel Close
  - Peer Online
  - Peer Offline
- Multiple notification providers support via [shoutrrr](https://github.com/nicholas-fedor/shoutrrr)
- Customizable message templates
- Event filtering

## Prerequisites
